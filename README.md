# Ju-jutsu kai

A personal Flutter project. I created this app partly to learn flutter, and partly
to create something that can be useful in my Jujutsu-training.

## Features

The main feature is an autogenerated test, which randomly selects techinques
based on your belt. This can be used to set up an impromptu training session,
consisting of techinques which you should already know.

Maybe more features will be implemented. The maintainer just needs to think of
useful features. Suggestions are welcome.
