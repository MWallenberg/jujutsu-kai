# Ju-jutsu kai

A personal Flutter project. I created this app partly to learn flutter, and partly
to create something that can be useful in my Jujutsu-training.

## Features

The main feature is an autogenerated test, which randomly selects techniques
based on your belt. This can be used to set up an impromptu training session,
consisting of techniques which you should already know.

Maybe more features will be implemented. The maintainer just needs to think of
useful features. Suggestions are welcome.

## How do I run this?

The app is created in Flutter. So, download Flutter following their [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install), 
and then run the following:

```bash
# To run debug build:
flutter run

# Or, to run in release mode:
flutter run --release
```
